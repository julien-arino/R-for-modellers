# <!--fit-->Note - Required reading/watching for MATH 2740 students

If you are a student in the University of Manitoba's Mathematics of Data Science course (MATH 2740), this is **required** reading/watching

Failure to use the "user friendly" method presented later will result in loss of marks in your `R` assignments!

# <!--fit-->When distributing your code, think of those using it

If you are using a slightly unusual library, it is possible that a person you share your code with does not have that library installed

In this case, it is nice to them if you spare them having to do the work to install the library

But it is also possible that they already have the library

In this case, it will be annoying to them if you trigger an installation of the library (especially under linux, since there libraries are compiled for installation)

---

So the way to proceed is to test whether the library is installed

If it is, load it

If it is not, install it then load it
