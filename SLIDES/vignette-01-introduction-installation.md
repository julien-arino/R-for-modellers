# R was originally for stats but is now much more

- Open source version of S
- Appeared in 1993
- Now (2024-01) version 4.3
- One major advantage in my view: uses a lot of C and Fortran code. E.g., `deSolve`:
> The functions provide an interface to the FORTRAN functions 'lsoda', 'lsodar', 'lsode', 'lsodes' of the 'ODEPACK' collection, to the FORTRAN functions 'dvode', 'zvode' and 'daspk' and a C-implementation of solvers of the 'Runge-Kutta' family with fixed or variable time steps
- Very active community on the web, easy to find solutions (same true of Python, I just prefer R)

# Development environments

- Terminal version, not very friendly
- Nicer terminal: [radian](https://github.com/randy3k/radian)
- Execute R scripts by using `Rscript name_of_script.R`. Useful to run code in `cron`, for instance
- Use IDEs:
    - [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) has become the reference
    - [RKWard](https://invent.kde.org/education/rkward) is useful if you are for instance using an ARM processor (Raspberry Pi, some Chromebooks..)
- Integrate into jupyter notebooks

# Going further

- [RStudio server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#rstudio-server): run RStudio on a Linux server and connect via a web interface
- Shiny: easily create an interactive web site running R code
- [Shiny server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/): run Shiny apps on a Linux server
- Rmarkdown: markdown that incorporates R commands. Useful for generating reports in html or pdf, can make slides as well..
- RSweave: LaTeX incorporating R commands. Useful for generating reports. Not used as much as Rmarkdown these days

# R is a scripted language

- Interactive
- Allows you to work in real time
    - Be careful: what is in memory might involve steps not written down in a script
    - If you want to reproduce your steps, it is good to write all the steps down in a script and to test from time to time running using `Rscript`: this will ensure that all that is required to run is indeed loaded to memory when it needs to, i.e., that it is not already there..

# Similar to matlab..

.. with some differences, of course! Otherwise, where would the fun be? ;)
