# Embarrassingly parallel problems

Some of the computational tasks we perform are embarrassingly parallel: they can be split into independent sub-tasks that can be run in parallel

For example, independent simulations of a stochastic process or evaluation of the output of a function at different parameter values

These problems are easy to parallelise

---

# Benefits of parallelisation 

- If your task is simple enough, you get a speed-up that is close to the number of cores you have available
  - If you have 8 threads and are evaluating a function at 8 different parameter values, then the 8 calls can happen simultaneously
- If your task is more complex, you get a speed-up, but it will be less than the number of cores you have available
  - There is some overhead associated with parallelisation
  - Some tasks are already parallelised (e.g. matrix multiplication), which means that you do not get a speed-up if you parallelise them again

# Amdahl's law

$$
  S_{\text{latency}}(s)=
  \frac {1}{(1-p)+p/s}
$$

where
- $S_{\text{latency}}$ is the theoretical speedup of the execution of the whole task
- $s$ is the speedup of the part of the task that benefits from improved system resources
- $p$ is the proportion of execution time that the part benefiting from improved resources originally occupied
