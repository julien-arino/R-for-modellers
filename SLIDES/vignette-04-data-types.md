# Assignment

Two ways:

```
X <- 10
```

or

```
X = 10
```

First version is preferred by R purists.. I don't really care

---

# Lists

A very useful data structure, quite flexible and versatile. Empty list: `L <- list()`. Convenient for things like parameters. For instance

```
L <- list()
L$a <- 10
L$b <- 3
L[["another_name"]] <- "Plouf plouf"
```

```
> L[1]
$a
[1] 10
> L[[2]]
[1] 3
> L$a
[1] 10
> L[["b"]]
[1] 3
> L$another_name
[1] "Plouf plouf"
```

---

# Vectors

```
x = 1:10
y <- c(x, 12)
> y
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 12
z = c("red", "blue")
> z
[1] "red"  "blue"
z = c(z, 1)
> z
[1] "red"  "blue" "1"
```
Note that in `z`, since the first two entries are characters, the added entry is also a character. Contrary to lists, vectors have all entries of the same type

---

# Matrices

Matrix (or vector) of zeros
```
A <- mat.or.vec(nr = 2, nc = 3)
```

Matrix with prescribed entries

```
B <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4), nr = 2, nc = 2)
> B
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    3
[2,]    2    4
C <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4), nr = 2, nc = 2, byrow = TRUE)
> C
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    2
[2,]    3    4
```

Remark that here and elsewhere, naming the arguments (e.g., `nr = 2`) allows to use arguments in any order

# Matrix operations

Probably the biggest annoyance in R compared to other languages

- The notation `A*B` is the *Hadamard product* $A\circ B$ (what would be denoted `A.*B` in matlab), not the standard matrix multiplication
- Matrix multiplication is written `A %*% B`

---

# Vector operations

Vector addition is also frustrating. Say you write `x=1:10`, i.e., make the vector
```
> x
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
```
Then `x+1` gives
```
> x+1
 [1]  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11
 ```
 i.e., adds 1 to all entries in the vector

 Beware of this in particular when addressing sets of indices in lists, vectors or matrices

---

# For the matlab-ers here

- R does not have the keyword `end` to access the last entry in a matrix/vector/list..
- Use `length` (lists or vectors), `nchar` (character chains), `dim` (matrices.. careful, of course returns 2 values)
