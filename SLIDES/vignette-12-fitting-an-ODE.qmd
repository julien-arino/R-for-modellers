# Fitting data

- Note that this is a super simplified version of what to do
- Much more elaborate procedures exist
  - Roda. [Bayesian inference for dynamical systems](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2019.12.007)

- Let us grab some epi data online and fit an SIR model to it
- Do not expect anything funky, as I said, this is the baby version
- Also, keep in mind that any identification procedure is subject to risks due to *identifiability issues*; see, e.g., Roda et al, [Why is it difficult to accurately predict the COVID-19 epidemic?](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.03.001)

# Principle

- Data is a set $(t_i,y_i)$, $i=1,\ldots,N$, where $t_i\in\mathcal{I}$, some interval
- Solution to SIR is $(t,x(t))$ for $t\in\mathcal{I}$
- Suppose parameters of the model are $p$
- We want to minimise the error function
$$
E(p) = \sum_{i=1}^N \|x(t_i)-y_i\|
$$

- Norm is typically Euclidean, but could be different depending on objectives
- So given a point $p$ in (admissible) parameter space, we compute the solution to the ODE, compute $E(p)$
- Using some minimisation algorithm, we seek a minimum of $E(p)$ by varying $p$

# What are $y_i$ and $x(t_i)$ here?

- In epi data for infectious diseases, we typically have incidence, i.e., number of new cases per unit time
- In SIR model, this is $\beta SI$ or $\beta SI/N$, so, if using mass action incidence and Euclidean norm
$$
E(p)=\sum_{i=1}^N(\beta S(t_i)I(t_i)-y_i)^2
$$
or, if using standard incidence
$$
E(p)=\sum_{i=1}^N
\left(\beta \frac{S(t_i)I(t_i)}{N}-y_i\right)^2
$$

# Implementing in practice

See the code [practicum_01_fitting.R](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/julien-arino/3MC-course-epidemiological-modelling/main/CODE/practicum_01_fitting.R), which we will go over now
