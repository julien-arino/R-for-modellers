# [What are "vignettes"?]{.r-fit-text}

---

- In the `R` world, vignettes are short "wordy" introductions to a topic or package


- Vignettes are more user friendly than package manuals or help pages, they provide a narrative

- Example: [deSolve](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deSolve/index.html)

# [What's in *my* vignettes?]{.r-fit-text}

---

- How-to's explaining how to attack some particular problems in `R`

- Focus on problems that are relevant to mathematical modellers

# [Who's this for?]{.r-fit-text}

---

- Modellers interested in using `R` instead of `python`, `matlab`, `mathematica`, `maple`, etc.

- Students in Summer schools or one of the math epi or modelling courses I teach here and there 

- Students registered in one of the courses I teach at UM in which I use `R`: some of the vignettes are required reading for you!

# [Organisation of the vignettes]{.r-fit-text}

## Organi-what?

- Essentially, there is none! 

- I have tried to group similar topics ... with more or less success

# [The GitHub repo(sitory)]{.r-fit-text}

## Two forms

- [As a webpage](https://julien-arino.github.io/R-for-modellers/)
- [As a repo](https://github.com/julien-arino/R-for-modellers)

# [Caveats]{.r-fit-text}

## This is work in progress

- Likely to contain typos
- All the vignettes are not ready yet
- Hint: if there is a video for a vignette, it is "more ready"
