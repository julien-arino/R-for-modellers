# What are "vignettes"?

---

![](FIGS/vignette.png){fig-align="center"}

## Vignettes in R

<br>

- In the `R` world, vignettes are short "wordy" introductions to a topic or package

<br>

- Vignettes are more user friendly than package manuals or help pages, they provide a narrative

<br>

- Example: [deSolve](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deSolve/index.html)

# What's in *my* vignettes?

---

## These vignettes

<br>

- How-to's explaining .. how to attack some particular problems in `R`

<br>

- Focus on problems that are relevant to mathematical modellers

# Who's this for?

## Who is this for?

- Modellers interested in using `R` instead of `python`, `matlab`, `mathematica`, `maple`, etc.

<br>

- Students in Summer schools or one of the math epi or modelling courses I teach here and there 

<br>

- Students registered in one of the courses I teach at UM in which I use `R`: some of the vignettes are required reading for you!

# Organisation of the vignettes

## Organi-what?

<br>

- Essentially, there is none! 

<br>

- I have tried to group similar topics ... with more or less success

# The GitHub repo(sitory)

## Two forms

<br>

- [As a webpage](https://julien-arino.github.io/R-for-modellers/)

<br>

- [As a repo](https://github.com/julien-arino/R-for-modellers)

# Caveats

## This is work in progress

<br>

- Likely to contain typos

<br>

- All the vignettes are not ready yet

<br>

- Hint: if there is a video for a vignette, it is "more ready"
