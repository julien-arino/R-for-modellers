# Posit

- [Posit](https://posit.co/) was formerly called `RStudio`, like their main product

- Did a lot of development for `R`, still do even on the open source side of things

- For-profit company, sells "pro" versions of its open source products

- IMOBO: in the process of moving to the "dark side", trying to ram "pro" versions down your throat

- You can completely exist without using the pro versions, though, don't worry!

# RStudio

- [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) has become the reference IDE for `R`
- [Download link](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), since the main download links appear broken

# RStudio server

- [RStudio server](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio-server/): run RStudio on a Linux server and connect via a web interface
- [Download link](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-server/), since the main download links appear broken
- Note that as far as I can tell, there is no mechanism to auto-update RStudio-server, so you will have to program something or check the site regularly..
