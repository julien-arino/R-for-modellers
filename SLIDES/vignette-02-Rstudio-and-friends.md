# Posit

- [Posit](https://posit.co/) was formerly called `RStudio`, like their main product

- Did a lot of development for `R`, still do even on the open source side of things

- For-profit company, sells "pro" versions of its open source products

- IMOBO: in the process of moving to the "dark side", trying to ram "pro" versions down your throat

- You can completely exist without using the pro versions, though, don't worry!

# RStudio

- [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) has become the reference IDE for `R`
- [Download link](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), since the main download links appear broken

# RStudio server

- [RStudio server](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio-server/): run RStudio on a Linux server and connect via a web interface
- [Download link](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-server/), since the main download links appear broken
- Note that as far as I can tell, there is no mechanism to auto-update RStudio-server, so you will have to program something or check the site regularly..

# RMarkdown

- Rmarkdown: markdown that incorporates R commands
- Useful for generating reports in html, pdf or doc, can make slides as well..
- See [Vignette 13](https://julien-arino.github.io/R-for-modellers/SLIDES/vignette-13-RMarkdown.html)

# Sweave

- Sweave: LaTeX incorporating R commands
- Useful for generating pdf reports
- Not used as much as Rmarkdown these days, probably because Rmarkdown allows output also in html and doc
- If you have a whole document to typeset using LaTeX, then still the best option
- See [Vignette 14](https://julien-arino.github.io/R-for-modellers/SLIDES/vignette-14-Sweave.html)

# Quarto

- Promoted as next-gen version of Sweave/RMarkdown
- Will confess that I have not yet seen why switch
- See [Vignette 15](https://julien-arino.github.io/R-for-modellers/SLIDES/vignette-15-Quarto.html)

# Shiny server

- [Shiny server](https://posit.co/products/open-source/shinyserver/): run Shiny apps on a Linux server
- Useful for instance if you have a Linux VM running somewhere
- See, e.g., my instance [here](https://daytah-or-dahtah.ovh:3838/)
- See [Vignette 17](https://julien-arino.github.io/R-for-modellers/SLIDES/vignette-17-Shiny-server.html)
