In the `R` world, vignettes are short "wordy" introductions to a topic or package


They are more user friendly than package manuals or help pages

Example: [deSolve](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deSolve/index.html)

# <!--fit-->What's in my vignettes?

---

How-to's explaining how to implement some particular problems in `R`

Focus on problems that are relevant to mathematical modellers

# <!--fit-->Who's this for?

---

Modellers interested in using `R` instead of `python`, `matlab`, `mathematica`, `maple`, etc.

Students in Summer schools or one of the math epi or modelling courses I teach here and there 

Students registered in one of the courses I teach at UM in which I use `R`: some of the vignettes are required reading for you!

Essentially, there is none! 

I have tried to group similar topics ... with more or less success
